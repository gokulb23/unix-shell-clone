# unix-shell-clone

Built a basic UNIX shell called goksh. It has 4 built-in commands: exit, cd, path, if. 
Executables can be run if they are in a directory specified via path. 
The only default directory is /bin. Redirection(>) to files is possible with executables.
 
if usage is as follows:
wish> if some\_command == 0 then some\_other\_command fi
